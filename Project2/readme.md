Here I have implemented a modal window. Now what is a modal window?

The screenshot attached below can be considered a close real world example to my idea of a modal window:

The features implemented by such a window are:

1. The window appears on click
2. Closes on clicking the 'X', pressing the escape key or clicking anywhere in the overlay (area outside the window)
