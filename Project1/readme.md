Here I have developed a web game where the user is required to guess a randomly generated number (hidden in ?) between 1 and 20 in 20 guesses

# User Interface

# Working
1. User enters a number in the box
2. Then clicks on the check button
3. Score= 20 - no. of guesses 
4. Again button restarts the game from 0

# Making guesses
Upon clicking the 'check' button an appropriate message is flashed based on how close the guess is to the number

## Guess> Number

## Guess < Number

## Correct guess
